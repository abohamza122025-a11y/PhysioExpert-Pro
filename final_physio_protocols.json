These can include: \n- **Joint Mobilizations/Manipulations**: To restore joint play and reduce hypomobility in the lumbar spine and sacroiliac joint, if indicated. \n- **Soft Tissue Mobilization**: Techniques such as massage, myofascial release, or instrument-assisted soft tissue mobilization (IASTM) to address muscle spasms, trigger points, and fascial restrictions in paraspinal muscles, glutes, and hip musculature. \n- **Neural Mobilization**: If there is evidence of neural tension or entrapment, gentle nerve glides or tensioners can be incorporated to improve nerve mobility.",

Discontinue or modify exercises if pain significantly increases, new neurological symptoms emerge, or dizziness occurs. Ensure proper form and controlled movements to prevent injury aggravation. Educate patients on body mechanics, posture, and ergonomics. Progress exercises gradually, respecting pain levels and tissue healing. Avoid exercises that centralize or worsen radicular symptoms if present."

Neural mobilization techniques (e.g., nerve flossing/gliding) are often beneficial to improve the mobility of the sciatic nerve.",

      "assessment_diagnosis": "Diagnosis of GBS is primarily clinical, based on acute progressive ascending weakness, areflexia, and often sensory symptoms. PT assessment includes detailed motor (MMT), sensory, reflex, cranial nerve, and respiratory function evaluations. Functional outcome measures (e.g., FIM, GBS Disability Scale, Berg Balance Scale, 6-Minute Walk Test) are used to track progress. Electrodiagnostic studies (Nerve Conduction Studies, EMG) typically confirm demyelination or axonal involvement.",
      "manual_therapy": "Gentle manual therapy techniques are employed cautiously. In the acute phase, PROM is crucial to prevent contractures. Soft tissue mobilization (gentle massage, effleurage) can help reduce muscle spasm, improve circulation, and alleviate pain. Joint mobilizations (Grades I-II) may be used to maintain joint play and address stiffness as tolerated, but aggressive techniques are contraindicated due to potential for exacerbating nerve irritation or pain. Peripheral nerve mobilization may be considered in later stages if specific nerve entrapment symptoms are present, always with careful monitoring for adverse reactions.",
      "precautions": "1. **Over-fatigue**: The most critical precaution. Over-exertion can lead to a significant worsening of weakness and prolonged recovery ('post-exertional fatigue' or 'activity-induced fatigue'). Therapy should be short, frequent, and avoid fatigue. 2. **Respiratory Compromise**: Closely monitor respiratory rate, depth, and effort. Be alert for signs of respiratory muscle weakness, dyspnea, or changes in vocal quality. 3. **Autonomic Dysfunction**: Monitor vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate) for orthostatic hypotension, arrhythmias, or other dysautonomia. 4. **Pain**: Neuropathic pain can be severe; manage with appropriate modalities and positioning. 5. **Skin Integrity**: Due to immobility and potential sensory loss, regularly check for skin breakdown. 6. **Fall Risk**: High risk due to weakness, sensory deficits, and balance impairments. Ensure appropriate supervision and assistive devices. 7. **Joint Integrity**: Protect weak joints from overstretching or injury; use proper body mechanics and supports. 8. **Emotional Support**: GBS can cause significant anxiety and depression; provide psychological support and refer as needed."

Collaboration with rheumatologist for serological tests (RF, anti-CCP), inflammatory markers (ESR, CRP), and imaging (X-rays, MRI) is crucial for diagnosis and disease activity monitoring.",
      "manual_therapy": "Gentle joint mobilizations (grades I-II) may be used to reduce pain and maintain joint play, particularly in non-inflamed joints or during periods of remission. Soft tissue mobilization and myofascial release techniques can address secondary muscle guarding and trigger points. Traction for cervical spine involvement may be cautiously considered. Aggressive mobilization or manipulation is strictly contraindicated during acute inflammatory flares due to risk of exacerbating joint damage.",
      "precautions": "Avoid over-stressing inflamed joints; respect pain as a guide. Monitor for signs of increased inflammation (pain, swelling, redness, warmth) and adjust exercise intensity accordingly. Ensure proper joint protection techniques are consistently applied in daily activities. Be mindful of systemic fatigue and malaise; incorporate energy conservation strategies. Educate patients on medication adherence and the importance of regular rheumatologist follow-ups. Monitor for potential side effects of medications (e.g., corticosteroid-induced osteopenia).",

Specific meniscal mobilization techniques might be cautiously used by experienced therapists to improve meniscal motion or reduce impingement, but care must be taken to respect tissue healing and avoid aggravating the tear.",

Respect pain as a guide; activities causing sharp pain, clicking, or locking should be avoided or modified. Monitor for increased swelling or instability. Progress exercises gradually, ensuring adequate rest and recovery. For surgically repaired menisci, strict adherence to weight-bearing restrictions and range of motion limitations imposed by the surgeon is critical.

Key assessments include goniometric measurement of knee range of motion (full extension is paramount), circumferential measurements for swelling, Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for pain, manual muscle testing (MMT) and dynamometry for quadriceps and hamstring strength, gait analysis, balance tests (e.g., BESS, Star Excursion Balance Test), and functional hop tests (e.g., single hop for distance, triple hop for distance, crossover hop for distance) in later phases. Graft integrity is assumed post-surgically, but any clinical signs of instability or persistent locking/clicking warrant immediate medical consultation.",
      "manual_therapy": "Aggressive patellar mobilizations (superior, inferior, medial, lateral) are crucial from early post-op to prevent arthrofibrosis and restore patellar mobility, which is essential for achieving full knee flexion and extension. Soft tissue mobilization to the quadriceps, hamstrings, gastrocnemius, and surrounding musculature to address muscle guarding, reduce adhesions, and improve tissue extensibility. Gentle joint mobilizations (e.g., posterior glide of tibia on femur, anterior glide of femur on tibia) can be introduced cautiously in later phases to restore accessory motion as tolerated, always respecting graft healing and patient symptoms.",
      "precautions": "1. **Graft Protection**: Avoid open-chain terminal knee extension (0-30 degrees) with resistance in early to mid-phases, especially if a hamstring or patellar tendon graft was used, due to high anterior shear forces on the healing graft. Quadriceps graft may tolerate it sooner but caution is still advised. 2. **Weight-Bearing**: Strict adherence to the surgeon's prescribed weight-bearing protocol is critical in the initial weeks. 3. **Range of Motion**: Early achievement of full passive knee extension is paramount. Avoid forceful or aggressive knee flexion beyond comfort in early phases to prevent overstretching or damaging the healing graft. 4. **Pain & Swelling**: Monitor and manage pain and swelling diligently. Persistent or increasing pain/swelling should prompt a re-evaluation of the exercise program or referral back to the surgeon. Exercises should not cause pain greater than 3/10. 5. **Return to Sport**: Return to high-impact or pivoting sports should be based on objective criteria (e.g., strength >90% contralateral limb, passing functional hop tests, psychological readiness) rather than solely on time post-op (typically a minimum of 9-12 months). The risk of re-injury is highest within the first year."

    "clinical_notes": {
      "assessment_diagnosis": "Diagnosis of TOS is primarily clinical, based on patient history (symptoms provoked by overhead activities, sustained postures, or carrying heavy objects) and a thorough physical examination. Key diagnostic tests include provocative maneuvers such as Adson's test, Roos test (elevated arm stress test), Wright's test, and costoclavicular maneuver, which aim to reproduce or exacerbate symptoms. Palpation of supraclavicular fossa for tenderness, muscle hypertrophy (e.g., scalenes), or palpable supraclavicular mass is important. Differential diagnosis includes cervical radiculopathy, carpal tunnel syndrome, cubital tunnel syndrome, and rotator cuff pathology. Electrophysiological studies (nerve conduction velocity, EMG) and vascular studies (Doppler ultrasound, angiography) may be used to confirm neurovascular involvement or rule out other conditions.",
      "manual_therapy": "Manual therapy techniques play a crucial role in TOS rehabilitation. This includes soft tissue mobilization and myofascial release for tight muscles in the neck, shoulder, and chest, such as the scalenes, sternocleidomastoid, pectoralis minor, and upper trapezius. Trigger point release may also be indicated. Joint mobilization/manipulation (Grade I-V) may be performed on the cervical and thoracic spine, first rib, and sternoclavicular/acromioclavicular joints to improve segmental mobility and reduce mechanical compression. Neural mobilization techniques (nerve gliding/flossing) are essential to improve the mobility of the brachial plexus and reduce neural tension. Proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF) techniques can also be incorporated to improve motor control and muscle activation patterns. Postural correction and education are integrated throughout the treatment plan.",
      "precautions": "Avoid activities, positions, and exercises that significantly provoke or worsen symptoms, especially those involving sustained overhead arm positions, repetitive arm movements, or heavy lifting. Monitor closely for signs of worsening neurological (e.g., increased numbness, weakness, paresthesia, loss of fine motor control) or vascular (e.g., skin discoloration, swelling, coldness, claudication, loss of pulse) compromise. Patient education is vital regarding appropriate pacing, symptom monitoring, and avoiding overexertion. Ensure all exercises are performed within a pain-free range. Refer back to the physician if symptoms escalate, new red flag symptoms emerge (e.g., acute vascular changes, signs of infection, unexplained weight loss), or if conservative management fails to provide adequate relief.",

      "manual_therapy": "Once acute inflammation is under control, manual therapy can include gentle soft tissue mobilization or cross-friction massage to the APL and EPB tendons to improve tissue mobility and reduce adhesions. Joint mobilizations to the radio-carpal, mid-carpal, and carpometacarpal (CMC) joints of the thumb may be performed to improve accessory motion and reduce compensatory stresses on the affected tendons. Neural gliding techniques for the superficial radial nerve may also be considered if nerve irritation is suspected.",
      "precautions": "Strict avoidance of activities that exacerbate pain is crucial, especially repetitive thumb abduction with ulnar deviation, forceful gripping, or pinching. Patients should be educated on proper body mechanics and activity modification. Splinting (e.g., a thumb spica splint or brace that immobilizes the thumb and wrist) may be used in the acute phase to provide rest and support for the tendons. Monitor for signs of increased inflammation, persistent pain, or any symptoms suggestive of nerve irritation. Gradual progression of exercises is essential to prevent re-aggravation."

Cognitive screening (e.g., MoCA) and assessment of fear of falling (e.g., FES-I) are crucial. Differential diagnosis with other forms of parkinsonism should be considered, and medication timing (on/off periods) significantly impacts assessment and intervention planning.",

Techniques include gentle joint mobilizations for spine and peripheral joints (e.g., shoulder, hips), soft tissue mobilization, myofascial release, and passive stretching to reduce stiffness, improve flexibility, and alleviate pain in the neck, shoulders, and trunk. PNF stretching can be incorporated to facilitate larger, rotational movements. It is not a primary treatment for PD itself but plays a vital supportive role in symptom management and increasing comfort for exercise participation.",
      "precautions": "Monitor vital signs, especially for orthostatic hypotension, which is common. Be aware of medication timing ('on'/'off' periods) and schedule therapy during 'on' periods for optimal patient performance and safety. Watch for fatigue, dyskinesias, and dystonia, adjusting intensity and duration accordingly. Ensure a safe environment to prevent falls, especially during balance and gait training; use assistive devices as needed. Educate on 'freezing of gait' and external cueing strategies. Educate patients and caregivers on fall prevention, home modifications, and energy conservation techniques. Avoid exercises that significantly increase fall risk without adequate supervision or assistive devices. Consider cognitive status when providing instructions, using clear, concise language and demonstrations."
